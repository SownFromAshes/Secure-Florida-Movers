                                <p>We recommend booking your move at least 2-4 weeks in advance for local moves and 4-8 weeks for long-distance moves. During peak season (May through September), it's best to book even earlier. However, we often accommodate last-minute moves based on availability.</p>

                                <p>A binding estimate is a fixed price that won't change regardless of the actual weight or time taken.
